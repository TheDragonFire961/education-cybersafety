Education Cybersafety is a website designed to educate Queenslanders on best practices online.

## Execution instructions
### Windows
These steps *should* work on the majority of Windows computers. If it does not, you might have a different program delegated to execute HTML files; read the Advanced subsection for workarounds and solutions, of if you want to use a different browser.
1. Make sure you have navigated to in the root directory of this project. It is the same directory this README.md file is stored in.
2. *Double-click* the "index.html" or "index" file. If you see the latter only, you might have file extensions turned off, but this is not a *huge* issue.
3. The web browser you have set up to run HTML files (usually Microsoft Edge on W10 computers, Internet Explorer in older versions) should show you the project.
#### Advanced
1. Make sure you have navigated to in the root directory of this project. It is the same directory this README file is stored in.
2. *Right-click* the "index.html" or "index" file. If you see the latter only, you might have file extensions turned off, but this is not a *huge* issue.
3. Hover over "Open with" in the context menu.
4. Select your browser of choice. If you see it, skip #5 and #6.
5. Click "Choose another app".
6. In the screen that appears, choose your browser of choice. If you *still* do not see your browser, we're getting into more advanced methods that go beyond the scope of this README. Please look up instructions for your respective browser.

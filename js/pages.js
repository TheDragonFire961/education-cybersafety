    What will eventually end up in this JS script needs to be prepared by Lilly first, since I'm 
	distracted with coding this piece of crap; then it can be codified by me to make a page that 
	can be shown by the JS. We use the text.js functions to accomplish this. Note that all fonts
    render as Open Sans. Any .docx advanced formatting _will_ probably be lost unless it has a
    HTML equivelent. 	
	All of Lilly's work is located in the root/docs directory.
